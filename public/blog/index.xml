      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started window shopping for a new job lately. Not too actively, just sent out my resume to a couple places I had always wanted to work at, some quick hello&amp;rsquo;s to a couple people I know. A friend told me about a start up that I was pretty excited about, so I sent them a quick email, and got sent back a code challenge. Fair enough, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind a good code challenge, and might as well exercise that muscle if I do get serious about chasing my next opportunity.</description>
