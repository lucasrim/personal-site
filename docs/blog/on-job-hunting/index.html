                <p>I&rsquo;ve started window shopping for a new job lately. Not too actively, just sent out my resume to a couple places I had always wanted to work at, some quick hello&rsquo;s to a couple people I know. A friend told me about a start up that I was pretty excited about, so I sent them a quick email, and got sent back a code challenge. Fair enough, I don&rsquo;t mind a good code challenge, and might as well exercise that muscle if I do get serious about chasing my next opportunity. Whipped up something in an hour and sent it over&hellip; Radio silence.</p>

<p>I gotta say, that&rsquo;s super damn frustrating.</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to proclaim myself to be coding jesus. I&rsquo;m really not. However, I would say, as a person with about just over 1 year experience, I&rsquo;m right about where I should be. But that&rsquo;s not really the point. If I made the most garbage code on Earth&hellip; I think it still warrants a response. I mean, especially if you demand an involved challenge.</p>

<em>Coding Jesus at work</em></p>

<p>I mean, at ReviewTrackers, we deal with excellent code, and some&hellip; Not so great. And if we see people making not great code, we don&rsquo;t chastise, they aren&rsquo;t less valuable, they aren&rsquo;t less deserving of our time. We talk, discuss, and help both people engaging in conversation to grow. Would I frame this bit of code on my wall? Tattoo it on my first born son&rsquo;s forehead? No&hellip; But I&rsquo;m not ashamed of showing it off (I doubt anyone would read this, but if anyone wants to see it, they are free to email me at <a href="mailto:me@lucasrim.cool">me@lucasrim.cool</a> and request, I&rsquo;ll send it over). I have been sitting around kinda moping about this recently, wondering if I embarassed myself by even trying (imposter syndrome really sucks), but reflecting on it today, if a company deems my time so worthless, it&rsquo;s probably not a great idea to dedicate my 9AM - 5PM, M-F&rsquo;s to them.</p>
