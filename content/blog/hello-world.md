I've started window shopping for a new job lately. Not too actively, just sent out my resume to a couple places I had always wanted to work at, some quick hello's to a couple people I know. A friend told me about a start up that I was pretty excited about, so I sent them a quick email, and got sent back a code challenge. Fair enough, I don't mind a good code challenge, and might as well exercise that muscle if I do get serious about chasing my next opportunity. Whipped up something in an hour and sent it over... Radio silence.

I gotta say, that's super damn frustrating.

I mean, I'm not going to proclaim myself to be coding jesus. I'm really not. However, I would say, as a person with about just over 1 year experience, I'm right about where I should be. But that's not really the point. If I made the most garbage code on Earth... I think it still warrants a response. I mean, especially if you demand an involved challenge.

I mean, at ReviewTrackers, we deal with excellent code, and some... Not so great. And if we see people making not great code, we don't chastise, they aren't less valuable, they aren't less deserving of our time. We talk, discuss, and help both people engaging in conversation to grow. Would I frame this bit of code on my wall? Tattoo it on my first born son's forehead? No... But I'm not ashamed of showing it off (I doubt anyone would read this, but if anyone wants to see it, they are free to email me at <me@lucasrim.cool> and request, I'll send it over). I have been sitting around kinda moping about this recently, wondering if I embarassed myself by even trying (imposter syndrome really sucks), but reflecting on it today, if a company deems my time so worthless, it's probably not a great idea to dedicate my 9AM - 5PM, M-F's to them.
