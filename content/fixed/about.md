# hi, i'm lucas.

Full-stack software engineer based in Chicago. 

I also do a lot of improv comedy around the city. If you'd like to contact me for your web needs, or are Lorne Michaels and SNL needs a new face, please contact me at <me@lucasrim.cool>.

Oh what's this, a [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/il6h41jrhzu87bc/lucas-rim-resume-final.pdf?dl=0)?
